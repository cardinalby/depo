# Depo Web Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the steps needed to complete the React rewrite of the original web application
located at `web` dir.

## Current Status

The project has several components and services already implemented:

- API service for communication with the backend
- Graph data structures and component types
- Some UI components (DependencyGraph, ComponentNode, Toolbar)
- A hook for fetching and polling graph data

## Missing Components and Actions

### 1. Application Structure

- [x] Create `index.tsx` as the entry point to render the React application
- [x] Create `App.tsx` as the main application component

No routing is needed.

### 2. Main Components

- [x] Complete the main application layout
- [x] Use Context API for state management
- [x] Create error boundaries and loading states

### 3. Features to Implement

- [x] Component details panel/modal for viewing and editing component properties
- [x] System status indicator

### 4. Integration and Polish

- [x] Connect all components to form a cohesive application
- [x] Add proper CSS styling (no need in external libs)
- [x] No animations needed

### 5. Testing and Documentation

- [x] No unit tests needed
- [x] Document how to build the app

### 6. Deployment

no deployment is required, just local development

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create `index.tsx` and `App.tsx`
2. Implement application state management
3. Connect existing components into a working UI
